<h1>Pokemon Memory Game</h1>

This project is part of <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application" target = "_blank">The Odin Project Curriculum (TOP)</a>, which is the first instance in which students use the useEffect hook, in this case, to fetch the Pokemon API on initial render.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
Below I am going to write some features that I would want to implement if I came back to the future, and some of the struggles I had regarding implementation / what I would need to improve on in the future.
<br>
<br>
Features To Add:
<ul>
  <li>3D Pokemon card to increase interactivability. When the pokemon card is clicked, ist shows the back of the card.</li>
  <li>Styling of the front side of the pokemon card to be more unique (maybe different types have preset styles)</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Areas of Struggle / What I need to research and improve on for the next project:
<ul>
  <li>Github commits - Before I start the next project, I will watch a video on the best habits for committing on github and test more commands like rebase, reset, etc.</li>
  <li>Mobile First Development and organizing css code - this time, I tried developing desktop first, but it just ended up making my css messy. Also, it's definitely okay to split components in css more than I did in this project.</li>
</ul>
